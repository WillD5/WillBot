# intro

sup, this is a general purpose discord bot mainly used for fun, it offers a few features such as annoying your friends, playing rock paper scissors and random number generation!

this is very much WIP and i'm doing my best to expand its purpose by the day, adding features/fixes whenever I find some time to devote to it

## so, how can i install this on my own pc, dud?
Clone the project on your machine and install the dependencies by running:
```node
npm i
```
Then, make a .env file with your values under this format:
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN = token_here
CLIENT_ID = client_id_here
```
Start the app with this command:
```node
nodemon index.js
```
